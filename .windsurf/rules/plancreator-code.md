# PlanCreator Code Rules

## General Guidelines

- Read the ARCHITECTURE.md document always at the start of a new thread for project structure and design patterns
- Read the concept/vision-and-system-overview.md always at the start of a new thread for system overview and vision
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Prioritize Great architecture, DX and UX.
- Stay consistent with the existing code.
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Never use TypeScript type "any"
- run "timeout 30 npx convex dev --once 2>&1 || true" to verify if your convex changes are valid
- validate your implementation with "pnpm check 2>&1" and "pnpm format && pnpm lint". Fix all errors and warnings related to your code.
